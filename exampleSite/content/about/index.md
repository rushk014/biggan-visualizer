title: "About the contents of this example site"
---

All content on this example site is taken from [_The Birds of Australia_, volume 2 of 7, by John Gould](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60302).

That book's available in full on Project ~~Gutenbird~~ Gutenberg. The illustrations are beautiful.

Note that many of the names of the birds have since changed, and there's [efforts underway in parts of Australia](https://www.dpaw.wa.gov.au/images/documents/about/science/cswa/articles/14.pdf) to start identifying these birds by the names used by local Aboriginal Australians.
