[Intro]
Believe me, it's me and you to the end
Yeah, so nice

[Verse: Anderson .Paak]
I don't even know how it feels anymore
Mmm
I don't even look at the reel anymore
I can only tell if it's mine or if it's yours
Mmm
I don't even know how it feels anymore
Yeah, yeah, oh, baby
Oh, seems like I got the double bag on a land mine
No tags on my black Polo, cold neckline
Spent a lot of dough, no small conversations
Singin' what you are, she said, "Where is you escapin'?"
You know who you are, you a star to me (You know who you are)
Don't know what you want but I love your dedication
You know who you are, a star
Dolo, got me me thinkin' bout monogamy
Chicken chili when I gotta chase
Six A.M. is when I gots to leave
Catchin' feelings, that's your hobby, right?
I'm supposed to be an honorable king
I love chillin' with the common types
Got my palm read
At least you got the riser right
What's the odds you the kind I like?
Bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread
[Outro]
Goddamn, you gotta lay off them backwoods, baby
