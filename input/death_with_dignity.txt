[Verse 1]
Spirit of my silence, I can hear you
But I’m afraid to be near you
And I don’t know where to begin
And I don’t know where to begin

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in the desert, there’s a forest
And an acre before us
But I don’t know where to begin
But I don’t know where to begin
Again, I've lost my strength completely, oh be near me
Tired, old mare with the wind in your hair

[Verse 3]
Amethyst and flowers on the table (On the table), is it real or a fable? (Is it real or a fable?)
Well, I suppose a friend is a friend
And we all know how this will end

[Verse 4]
Chimney swift that finds me, be my keeper (Be my keeper)
Silhouette of the cedar (Silhouette of the cedar)
What is that song you sing for the dead?
What is that song you sing for the dead?
I see the signal searchlight strike me in the window of my room
Well, I got nothing to prove
Well, I got nothing to prove
[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 5]
I forgive you, mother, I can hear you (I can hear you)
And I long to be near you (And I long to be near you)
But every road leads to an end
Yes, every road leads to an end
Your apparition passes through me in the willows
Five red hens – you’ll never see us again
You’ll never see us again

[Outro]
