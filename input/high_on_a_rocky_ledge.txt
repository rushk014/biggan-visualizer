High on a rocky ledge lives a mädel, Edelweiß
Shy as a shadow, lovely as lace, and cold as ice
High on a rocky ledge, I pledge my love to her
Ev'ry time I climb up to Paradise

How many times I've been up to see her, goodness knows
Huffing and puffing, dressed in the warmest climbing clothes
How many chances would be taken in my
Hopeless pursuit of the Schnee-Mädel-Edelweiß

Then spoke a spirit, "If you would win your Lady Love
There's only one way: fall to your death from high above
You will begin to grow in snow beside the one
You have waited for to be mated with"

Now, I'm an Edel, vice to my Mädel, Edelweiß
Dying to be with her wasn't any sacrifice
We're so deliriously happy on our ledge
Where I pledge my love to my Lady Fair

You who are climbing breathless to see me and my love
Snow flowers growing fonder on Lover's Ledge above
If you've the yen to pluck, then pluck us both
For we who have lived as one wish to die as one
